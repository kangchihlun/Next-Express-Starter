# Next.js Express Starter with Redis Background Worker

This template project combines the power of Next.js with Express.js backend and Redis-based background task processing. It provides a robust foundation for building full-stack applications with asynchronous task handling capabilities.

## Features

- 🚀 Next.js 14 with App Router
- ⚡ Express.js backend integration
- 🔄 Redis-based background task processing
- 📦 TypeScript support
- 🎯 API route handling
- 🔒 Environment variable management
- 🏗️ Modular project structure

## Project Structure

```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- Redis server
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Next-Express-Starter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Use Cases

This template is ideal for:

1. **Real-time Applications**
   - Chat applications
   - Live notifications
   - Real-time data processing

2. **Background Processing**
   - Email sending
   - File processing
   - Data aggregation
   - Report generation

3. **Task Queue Management**
   - Job scheduling
   - Batch processing
   - Rate-limited operations

4. **API Development**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - WebSocket connections
   - Microservices architecture

## Limitations

1. **Redis Dependency**
   - Requires a running Redis instance
   - No built-in fallback mechanism if Redis is unavailable
   - Task persistence depends on Redis configuration

2. **Scalability Considerations**
   - Single worker process by default
   - No built-in horizontal scaling
   - Memory usage increases with queue size

3. **Development Environment**
   - Requires local Redis installation
   - More complex setup compared to standard Next.js projects
   - Additional configuration needed for production deployment

4. **Task Management**
   - No built-in task prioritization
   - Limited task retry mechanisms
   - No native task monitoring dashboard

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, ensure:

1. Redis server is properly configured with persistence
2. Environment variables are securely set
3. Worker process is managed by a process manager (PM2, etc.)
4. Proper error handling and logging is implemented
5. Monitoring and alerting systems are in place
